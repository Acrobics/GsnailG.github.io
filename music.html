            <h2>Synrise - Soulwax Remix</h2>
            <p>
                This three minuite song I have found is only good when you have been combing your hair for the entire build up of the song, and then when the bass drops, you smash your head to the beat of the song. 10/10 would bang again
            </p>

            <h2>Giorgio by Moroder</h2>
            <p>
                A nine minuite trip through multiple genres of music, all while telling a fantastic story about the birth of some music genre or some shit, its just really nice to listen to.

            <p>
                This makes you wanna walk with your legs super high at each step, as two briliant songs mashed together to make something so good it can make anything shit turn to absoulte joy

                Ever wanted to whack a keyboard over someones face and watch as all the keys flyed away, this song basicly incapsualates that feeling of glitchyness and fun into around four minuites of mind melting music (this song doesnt really reflect the bones breaking
                part of the experince or the the epic police chase that comes after)

            <h2>Fix You</h2>
            <pre>fix you: coldplay
                just sitting at my desk, about to change the song to something else,
                and the lyrics just hit me like a train
                "when you love someone, but it goes two ways"
                and i figured out why, 
                i didnt like coldplay.
                and why i didnt like most of there songs, even if i really did.
                because the music is about life, 
                and how sometimes it can be bad, or good, or other things
                when i listen to music, its cause i wanna escape the current world, 
                with problems, and only listen to music
                but coldplay is different
                i used to not like coldplay
                but now
                i just dont like what coldplay talks about,
                cause its true.

            <p>it didnt matter that the song sounded nice, this song had and has the ability to make every single person sad 1/10</p>
