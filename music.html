        <div class="synrisesoulwax">
            <h2>Synrise - Soulwax Remix</h2>
            <p>
                This three minute song I have found is only good when you have been combing your hair for the entire build up of the song, and then when the bass drops, you smash your head to the beat of the song. 10/10 would bang again
            </p>

        <div class="giorgiobymoroder">
            <h2>Giorgio by Moroder</h2>
            <p>
                A nine minute trip through multiple genres of music, all while telling a fantastic story about the birth of some music genre or some shit, it's just really nice to listen to.
            </p>

        <div class="badpigges">
            <h2>We Are Number One but it's the Bad Piggies Theme</h2>
            <p>
                This makes you wanna walk with your legs super high at each step, as two brilliant songs mashed together to make something so good it can make anything shit turn to absolute joy

                Ever wanted to whack a keyboard over someone's face and watch as all the keys flies away, this song basically encapsulates that feeling of glitchiness and fun into around four minutes of mind melting music (this song doesn't really reflect the bones breaking
                part of the experience or the the epic police chase that comes after)
            </p>

            <h2>Genesis (KLOUD Remix)</h2>
            <p>remember the kid you smashed with that keyboard, yea? well consqesunces are a thing, and now the police are after you. This song should start at the moment you relized what you had done. (that being hiting a person). You run away from the
                body, blood dripping everywhere, the simple drum beat repeating over and over again. The police are already on the case, as two crown vics blast down the street, intiating a handbreak turn in the middle of the road. The rear doors open
                to reveal heavliy amored people and police dogs. They dont know where you are at the moment but it all changes in the snap of a bone (that being the bone you broke with the keyboard you whacked a person with). They have surrounded you
                and before you know it, its over.</p>

            <li>fix you: coldplay</li>
            <li>just sitting at my desk, about to change the song to something else,</li>
            <li>and the lyrics just hit me like a keyboard</li>
            <li>and i figured out why, </li>
            <li>i didn't like coldplay.</li>
            <li>and why i didn't like most of their songs, even if i really did.</li>
            <li>because their music is about life,</li>
            <li>and how sometimes it can be bad, or good, or other things</li>
            <li>when i listen to music, its cause i wanna escape the current world,</li>
            <li>with problems, and only listen to music</li>
            <li>but coldplay is different</li>
            <li>i used to not like coldplay</li>
            <li>but now</li>
            <li>i just don't like what coldplay talks about,</li>
            <li>because it's true.</li>

            <li>Sunday 6th June</li>
            <p>it didnt matter that the song sounded nice, this song had and has the ability to make every single person sad 1/10</p>
