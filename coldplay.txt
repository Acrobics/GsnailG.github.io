fix you: coldplay
just sitting at my desk, about to change the song to something else, and the lyrics just hit me like a train
and i figured out why 
i didnt like coldplay
and why i didnt like most of there songs, even if i really did
because the music is about life, and how sometimes it can be bad, or good, or other things
when i listen to music, its cause i wanna escape the current world, with problems, and only listen to music
but coldplay is different
i used to not like coldplay
but now
i just dont like what coldplay talks about
cause its true
